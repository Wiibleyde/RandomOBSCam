# obsAutoCam

This is a simple script to automatically switch between scenes in OBS Studio.

It is not finished yet, but it works. (the cam changes are only random for now, in the future it will be possible to set the scenes with logic)

## How to use

1. Start OBS Studio

2. Start the script

3. Fill the config file with the ip, port and password of your OBS Studio

4. Start the script again

And that's it. The script will now automatically switch between the scenes with specific names.

## Cam names

The script will only switch between scenes with the following names:
- Scene scenes : name contains "SCE"
- Public scenes : name contains "PUB"
- Piano scenes : name contains "PIA"
